<h1>{% block title %} Our Scoring System Explained {% endblock %}</h1>
<p>
    "The Scandal Sandal" is a comprehensive grading system designed to hold car manufacturers accountable for their
    actions, particularly when negative news arises about their products or services. This system not only serves to
    inform consumers but also encourages manufacturers to uphold higher standards of quality and customer service.
    Here's a detailed explanation of how the scoring system works:
</p>
<h2>Grading Mechanism for News Articles</h2>
<p>
    Whenever a news article is written about a car manufacturer, particularly one that highlights issues such as faulty
    software updates, manufacturing defects, or other significant problems, "The Scandal Sandal" grades the manufacturer
    based on their response and actions. Examples include, and are not limited to:
<ul>
    <li><b>Faulty Software Updates:</b> If a manufacturer releases a software update that bricks multiple vehicles.</li>
    <li><b>Manufacturing Defects:</b> If reports surface about a manufacturer consistently delivering cars with defects.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Purpose and Impact</h2>
<p>
    The primary goal of "The Scandal Sandal" is to hold car manufacturers accountable for their actions and ensure they
    take responsibility for any issues that arise. By making this information public, it empowers consumers with the
    knowledge they need to make informed purchasing decisions. This transparency also encourages manufacturers to
    prioritize quality and customer satisfaction to maintain a positive reputation.
</p>
<h2>Scoring Matrix</h2>
<p>
    The scores are derived from a strict scoring matrix, which is detailed in the image below.

<p>
    Each of these factors is assigned a weight, and the overall score is calculated based on a weighted average.
</p>

<h2>Manufacturer Transparency</h2>
<p>
    Car manufacturers do not have access to their scores before they are published. They cannot see, request, or
    influence their grading. This ensures that the scores remain unbiased and reflect an accurate assessment of the
    manufacturer's actions based on the criteria outlined in the scoring matrix.
</p>

<h2>Role of Advanced LLM</h2>
<p>
    The scoring process is assisted by an advanced Language Model (LLM). This LLM analyzes the content of news articles,
    identifies key details related to the issues, and applies the scoring matrix to generate an objective score. The use
    of LLM technology ensures consistency and accuracy in evaluating different cases and articles.
</p>
<h2>Reporting Discrepancies</h2>
<p>
    If any discrepancies are found in the scoring or if there are concerns about the evaluation process, individuals can
    contact "The Scandal Sandal" team directly by visiting <a href="{{url_for('contact')}}">the contact page</a>. This
    feedback mechanism allows for continuous improvement of the grading system and ensures that all scores are as fair
    and accurate as possible.
</p>
<p>
    By maintaining a transparent and rigorous grading system, "The Scandal Sandal" aims to foster accountability within
    the car manufacturing industry and provide consumers with reliable information to guide their purchasing decisions.
